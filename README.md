## ssbio
This Python package provides a collection of tools for people with questions in the realm
of structural systems biology. The main goals of this package are to:

    1. Provide an easy way to map genes to sequences and structures
    2. Prepare structures for downstream analyses, such as their use in molecular modeling software
    3. Directly link strutures to genome-scale SBML models
