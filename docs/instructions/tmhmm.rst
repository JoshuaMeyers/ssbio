Description
===========

* `TMHMM home page`_
* `TMHMM download page`_
* `TMHMM installation instructions`_

TMHMM is a program to predict the location of transmembrane helices in proteins, directly from sequence. *ssbio* provides a wrapper to execute and parse the "long" output format of TMHMM.


Instructions (Unix)
===================

.. note:: These instructions were created on an Ubuntu 17.04 system.

#. Register for the software (academic license only) at the `TMHMM download page`_
#. Receive instructions to download the software at your email address
#. Download the file *tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz*
#. Extract it to a place where you store software
#. Install it according to the `TMHMM installation instructions`_, repeated and annotated below...
    
    #. Insert the correct path for perl 5.x in the first line of the scripts bin/tmhmm and bin/tmhmmformat.pl (if not ``/usr/local/bin/perl``). Use ``which perl`` and ``perl -v`` in the terminal to help find the correct path.
    #. Make sure you have an executable version of *decodeanhmm* in the bin directory.
    #. Include the directory containing tmhmm in your path (how do I add something to my :ref:`dummiesunix-path`?)
    #. Read the TMHMM2.0.guide.html
    #. Run the program by doing the following:
       
        .. code-block:: console

            tmhmm my_sequences.fasta
