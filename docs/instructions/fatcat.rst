FATCAT is a structural alignment tool that allows you to determine the similarity of a pair of protein structures.

.. warning:: Parsing FATCAT results is currently incomplete and will only return TM-scores as of now - but TM-scores only show up in development versions of jFATCAT


Installation instructions
=========================

.. note:: These instructions were created on an Ubuntu 17.04 system.

#. Download the Java port of FATCAT from the `jFATCAT download page`_, under the section "Older file downloads" with the filename "protein-comparison-tool\_<DATE>.tar.gz"
#. Extract it to a place where you store software


Program execution
=================

In the shell
------------

* To run the program on its own in the shell...
   
    .. code-block:: console

        <code>

With *ssbio*
------------

* To run the program using the ssbio Python wrapper, see: :func:`ssbio.protein.structure.properties.fatcat.run_fatcat`. Run it on two structures, pointing to the path of the *runFATCAT.sh* script.
