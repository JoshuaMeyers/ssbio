*************************************************
ssbio: A Framework for Structural Systems Biology
*************************************************

Introduction
============

This Python package provides a collection of tools for people with questions in the realm of structural systems biology. The main goals of this package are to:

#. Provide an easy way to map proteins to sequences and structures
#. Directly link structures to genome-scale SBML models
#. Prepare structures for downstream analyses, such as their use in molecular modeling software

Example questions you can answer with this package:

- How can I determine the number of protein structures available for my list of genes?
- What is the best, representative structure for my protein?
- Where, in a metabolic network, do these proteins work?
- Where do popular mutations show up on a protein?
- How can I compare the structural features of entire proteomes?
- and more...

Installation
============
Clone this repository to any location and then install it.

Currently, use of this package can be cited by our 2016 paper in BMC Systems Biology [1]_, which details the GEM-PRO pipeline. The manuscript for the ``ssbio`` package itself is in preparation at this moment.
