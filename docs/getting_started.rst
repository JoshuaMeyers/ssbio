Introduction
============
This section will give a quick outline of the design of ``ssbio`` and the scientific topics behind it.


The basics
==========
``ssbio`` was developed with simplicity in mind, and also as a direct extension of COBRApy_. Furthermore, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel wherever possible, and thus Biopython_ classes and modules are used wherever possible.
