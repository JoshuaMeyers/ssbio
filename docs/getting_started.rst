Introduction
============
This section will give a quick outline of the design of ``ssbio`` and the scientific topics behind it.


The basics
==========
``ssbio`` was developed with simplicity in mind, and also as a direct extension of COBRApy_. Furthermore, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel wherever possible, and thus Biopython_ classes and modules are used wherever possible. To best explain the utility of the package, we will explain its features from 2 different viewpoints: 1) as a systems biologist used to looking at the "big picture", ie. from the top-down; and 2) as a structural biologist where the "devil is in the details", ie. from the bottom-up.

A top-down perspective
