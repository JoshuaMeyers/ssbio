GEM-PRO pipeline
=================================

The GEM-PRO pipeline is focused on annotating genome-scale models with
protein structure information. Any SBML model can be used as input to
the pipeline, although it is not required to have a one. Here are all possible
starting points:

* An SBML model in `.xml`, `.mat`, or `.json` formats
* A list of gene IDs (`['b0001', 'b0002', ...]`)
* A dictionary of gene IDs and their sequences (`{'b0001':'MSAVEVEEAP..', 'b0002':'AERAPLS', ...}`)
