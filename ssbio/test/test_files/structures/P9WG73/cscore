C-score is a confidence score of the I-TASSER predictions which
is typically in [-5,2]. TM-score and RMSD measure how close the
model is to the native structure and both are estimated based 
on the C-score. TM-score is in [0,1] with a value >0.5 implying 
the model of correct topology. The TM-score and RMSD estimations 
are made only for the first model because absolute values of 
TM-score and RMSD for the lower-rank models do not strongly 
correlate with the C-score. The models are ranked based on the 
structure density of I-TASSER simulations.
